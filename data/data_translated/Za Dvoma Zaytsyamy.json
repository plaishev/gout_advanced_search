Each restaurant has a certain menu, certain rules. We have several sites, each with a separate menu. The terraces overlooking the city offer light, refreshing meals and drinks during the summer, allowing you to enjoy both the taste and the wonderful weather. We serve dishes from the main off-season menu in an air-conditioned room, as well as in a specially thought-out interior in the style of the movie \"After Two Hares\". This is what our waiters tell us. To all our numerous guests from many countries of the world. And, since when they come to visit, the rules are not established, then everyone has the right to choose. And almost 18 years of successful experience of the restaurant shows that the choice in a very large number of cases is made in our direction.\nRegarding prices. Prices are based on what products are used, what the cooking process is. Our guests know that every dish ordered is prepared from under the knife, from the freshest quality products. We do not make blanks and do not use freezing. We respect ourselves and our guests. Based on this, a fair and quite reasonable price is formed. For example, a quail broth with pies with a rabbit, with an output of 300 grams, costs only 180 UAH (i.e. only 6 euros). And quail baked on a spit, served in 3 pieces with a small side dish, and which are usually ordered for several people, cost 450 hryvnia (i.e. 15 euros).\nWe are glad to each of our guests, with pleasure we will listen to all wishes and constructive criticism, and we plan to pamper those who have chosen our restaurant with delicious dishes of authentic Kiev cuisine for many years to come.", "rating": 1, "name": "–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ë—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü–∫–∏–π", "cat": "Ukrainian restaurant"}, {"review": "Lovely, cozy, trendy restaurant on Andreevsky Spusk.
