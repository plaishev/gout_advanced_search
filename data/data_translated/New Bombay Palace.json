Our dishes are also brought out not at the same time, but as each is prepared, so that they do not cool down. And immediately, as soon as the cooks cook hot, our waiters take it out. No one has ever complained that we take out cold dishes. Moreover, you yourself wrote that the main course was cold only because YOU did not immediately reach the point of eating it. As for the sauces, our Hindu chefs make them according to their own recipe and never spare spices. Perhaps you just like too spicy, and the dish you chose is not spicy. Then you had to ask the waiter and he would recommend a spicy sauce. Our prices correspond to the quality of the dishes and are not more expensive than in other similar restaurants in the capital. The cuisine is exclusively Indian, since all our cooks are only Hindus. And there is no fraud in this! This is a false and subjective opinion of competitors. Otherwise, attention should be paid to the positive aspects, of which we have much more.", "rating": 5, "name": "Carol Obrien", "cat": "Indian restaurant"}, {"review": "Food was truly delicious ‚ô•Ô∏è.

Accordingly, the time has come for us to rebrand.\nNevertheless, we tried to preserve the atmosphere of modern India as much as possible and thought out every detail to the smallest detail. In the new premises of the restaurant, there are many authentic elements in the decor and not only, the very sculpture of Shivi and others. Also in paintings, lampshades and other details - all of this can be traced to the traditional Indian style.\nSecond: We have not reduced the menu! On the contrary, they expanded it. There are many more positions and it is easy to check. Only the palette has become thinner due to the new design.\nTherefore, it may seem that less. And new dishes, desserts and drinks only increased.\nAnd one more thing: our cooks are exclusively Hindus - this is the peculiarity of the restaurant. But there are only two Indian waiters, as it was before (nothing has changed in this). One of them was serving your table. And the second is now on vacation and temporarily flew home for a well-deserved rest. As soon as the situation with leaving India stabilizes, he will be back in the ranks. But our Indian waiters always wear national clothes called \"kurta pajamas\".\nAs for the small hall, we have two of them. You probably didn't notice the lower floor. Now we have a hookah in our assortment. And on the lower floor there is a separate area for this, so as not to disturb other guests.\nBe sure to come to us again and pay attention to all of the above points.
