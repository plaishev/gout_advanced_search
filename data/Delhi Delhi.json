My friends come to me, I cook for their kids, and every dish is made not only with my hands, but with my heart as well. Maybe it's a joke that I didn't understand, but I honestly don't understand why you wrote such a review. I analyzed and all the orders of the week went through my mind, but I still didn't understand what was wrong. I will definitely wait for you next time and I am sure you will be happy.\n\n(Original)\nनमस्ते, मेरा नाम शमी है।  मैं इस रेस्टोरेंट में पहले दिन से ही भारतीय खाना बना रहा हूं।  मेरे दोस्त मेरे पास आते हैं, मैं उनके बच्चों के लिए खाना बनाती हूं, और हर व्यंजन न केवल मेरे हाथों से, बल्कि मेरे दिल से भी बनाया जाता है।  शायद यह एक ऐसा मजाक है जो मुझे समझ में नहीं आया, लेकिन मैं ईमानदारी से नहीं समझता कि आपने ऐसी समीक्षा क्यों लिखी।  मैंने विश्लेषण किया और सप्ताह के सभी आदेशों को मेरे दिमाग में चला गया, लेकिन मुझे अभी भी समझ में नहीं आया कि क्या गलत था।  मैं अगली बार आपका इंतजार जरूर करूंगा और मुझे यकीन है कि आप खुश रहेंगे।",

За время локдауна они так соскучились за гостями, что на радостях готовы их закружить по полной🥰\nЧто касается нашей лепешки-комплимента, она и должна быть подсушенной, ведь по индийскому поверью, когда крошится - это к богатству ✨\nЧем больше крошек, тем больше денег придёт в вашу жизнь. Сожалеем, что официант не рассказал вам эту легенду и вы не прочувствовали это волшебство 🤷‍♀️\nНо наша основная боль, это то, что вы не прониклись нашей кухней((( Позвольте нам исправить эту ситуацию и пригласить в гости вновь.

After all, this is the only way we can fix them.\nWe will definitely remind our staff once again about the need to keep their distance. During the lockdown, they missed the guests so much that, for joy, they are ready to whirl them in full\nAs for our compliment cake, it should be dried, because according to Indian belief, when it crumbles, it means wealth ✨\nThe more crumbs, the more money will come into your life. We are sorry that the waiter did not tell you this legend and you did not feel this magic 🤷‍♀️\nBut our main pain is that you are not imbued with our cuisine (((Let us correct this situation and invite you to visit again.

Нам дуже приємно, що ви не пошкодували свого часу і поділилися не лише враженнями, але й пропозиціями☺️\nДо страв індійської кухні входить багато спецій та прянощів, які ми мелемо відразу перед подачею, за рахунок цього їхні аромати стають ще насиченішим🙌🏻 І, звичайно, ці запахи чутно у залі — на нашу думку, це і додає колориту нашому закладу💫 також ми почали використовувати аромапалички, обов‘язково завітайте до нас ще раз і поділіться враженнями❤️\nНам дуже важлива ваша думка!",
