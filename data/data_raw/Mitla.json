First of all, the weight of 100 grams is indicated with all the weights. Secondly, why the menu has such dishes. This is due to the fact that, for example, steak on a bone is a product that has a variable weight, that is, it can be 350, 420 or 530 grams, and it is independent of the cooks. It is a pity that the waiter did not focus on this, but we are happy that you liked everything else. Thank you for your feedback!\n\n(Original)\nДоброго дня. Так, дійсно, в нашому меню є вагові страви, але це не є елементом обману. По-перше, поряд з усіма ваговими стравами зазначено \"вартість за 100 грамів\". По-друге, чому у меню є такі страви. Це пов'язано з тим що, наприклад, стейк на кісці, є продуктом, який має варіантивну вагу, тобто він може бути 350, 420 або 530 грамів, і це не залежить від кухарів.

We always have a lot of people and no such feedback🤦‍♀️ Thanks for the reply🙂\nMaybe the dishes you chose were too big for the girl, and you were blown away by borscht and vinaigrette, but that's just our opinion, because all the food is prepared in the morning and the products are always fresh, because they are brought to us every day. Maybe one day you will come to us and taste something from the main menu, and we will be a compliment from the institution❤❤❤\n\n(Original)\nДоброго дня,скажіть будь ласка що конкретно ви їли,та коли ви в нас були? В нас завжди багато людей та жодних таких відгуків🤦‍♀️ Дякуємо за відповідь🙂\nМожливо страви які ви обрали були завеликі для дівчини, а Вас дуло через борщ та вінигрет,але це тільки наша думка,бо вся їжа готується зранку та продукти завжди свіжі,бо нам їх привозять кожного дня😊Але все одно вибачте будь ласка за незручності. Можливо якось ви до нас приїдете і скуштуєте щось з основного меню,а з нас буде комплімент від закладу❤❤❤",
