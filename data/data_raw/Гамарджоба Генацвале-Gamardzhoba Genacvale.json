Вас обслуживали две девушки официанта!!!\nВам в чек добавили что то лишнее, чего вы не заказывали???\nВам было включено в счет ОБСЛУЖИВАНИЕ!!! Вам предложили ознакомиться с прейскурантом цен, которые согласованы дирекцией!!!\nКакой закон мы нарушаем? Можно конкретней статью и номер пункта?\nЭто наша ценовая политика ресторана, многие рестораны Киева берут плату в чеке за обслуживание, тем самым оплачивают зарплату персонала в зале!!! При этом не поднимая цены на блюда!!! Думаю в лояльности наших цен вы убедились, как для центра города?\nИ не путайте обслуживание, с чаевыми, которые оставляют лично официанту в знак того, что гость остался довольным обслуживанием и кухней!\n\nКаждый ресторан имеет право на свою ценовую политику, а также стоимость услуг!!! Мы очень уважительно относимся к нашим гостям, и вы уважайте нашу работу!\nИ не пишите эту чушь про нарушение законов, если сами ничего в этом не понимаете!\nВыглядит это оскорбительно!\nА если вы это пишите в интересах конкурентов- вам удачи в этом нелегком деле!\n\nИ последнее - почему у вас столько негатива, если вам все понравилась? У вас был \"совсем не большой счет\", вы оплатили 50грн ОБСЛУЖИВАНИЯ двум официантам за более двух часовую работу!!! Нужно ценить не только себя, а и людей вокруг!!!\n\n(Translated by Google)\nGamarjoba! What were you DECEDED about? Judging by your feedback, you did not have any complaints either to the dishes or to the service! You were our guest for more than 2 hours, there were three of you! You were served by two girls of the waiter !!!\nSomething superfluous was added to your check, which you did not order ???\nYou have been included in the account SERVICE !!! You were offered to familiarize yourself with the price list of prices, which are agreed by the management !!!\nWhat law are we breaking? Can you be more specific about the article and paragraph number?\nThis is our pricing policy of the restaurant, many restaurants in Kiev take a payment on the check for service, thereby paying the salaries of the staff in the hall !!! At the same time, without raising the prices of dishes !!! I think you are convinced of the loyalty of our prices, as for the city center?\nAnd do not confuse the service with a tip, which is left personally to the waiter as a sign that the guest was satisfied with the service and cuisine!\n\nEach restaurant has the right to its own pricing policy, as well as the cost of services !!! We are very respectful of our guests and you respect our work!\nAnd do not write this nonsense about breaking laws if you yourself do not understand anything about it!\nIt looks insulting!\nAnd if you write this in the interests of your competitors, good luck in this difficult matter!\n\nAnd the last thing - why do you have so much negativity if you liked everything? You had a \"not a big bill\", you paid 50 UAH SERVICE to two waiters for more than two hours of work !!! You need to appreciate not only yourself, but also the people around !!!",

Из вашего отзыва становится сразу не понятно, почему блюда нашей кухни далеки от определения \"хорошо\", при этом вы говорите, что они приближены к оригиналу, также отмечаете, что хинкали вкусные и сочные? Почему вы конкретно не говорите,  что не так и какое ожидание блюда у вас было? Это наталкивает на определенные мысли!\nПо поводу вина хотим сказать следующее - у нас в ресторане представлены марки грузинских вин «Kartuli Vazi» и «Mimino». Для ценителей грузинского вина здесь объяснять ничего не стоит! По поводу того, что вы написали дальше, про обслуживание и наш персонал - расцениваем это как личные оскорбления и хамство с вашей стороны!\nВ свою очередь мы детально изучили все отзывы, которые вы оставляете ресторанам Киева и не только! Там сплошной негатив, среди которого мы удостоились оценки \"3 бала\", за что большое вам спасибо! С какой целью вы это делаете - можно только догадываться!\n\n(Translated by Google)\nGood afternoon, Rynaya Cosmopolitan! From your review, it immediately becomes not clear why the dishes of our cuisine are far from the definition of “good”, while you say that they are close to the original, also note that the khinkali are tasty and juicy? Why do not you specifically say what was wrong and what kind of expectation of the meal did you have? This leads to certain thoughts!\nAs for the wine, we want to say the following - in our restaurant brands of Georgian wines “Kartuli Vazi” and “Mimino” are presented. For connoisseurs of Georgian wine, there is nothing worth explaining! Regarding what you wrote further about the service and our staff, we regard this as personal insults and rudeness on your part!\nIn turn, we thoroughly studied all the reviews that you leave to the restaurants of Kiev and not only! There is a solid negative, among which we were awarded the \"3 points\" rating, for which many thanks to you! For what purpose you are doing this - you can only guess!",

    "review": "Гамарджоба! Спасибо за отзыв! Мы во всем стремимся соответствовать неповторимой грузинской атмосфере, стилю, традициям и настоящей грузинской кухне!\n\nВвиду такого отзыва мы детально разобрались в ситуации! С нашей стороны можем сказать следующее, вы посещали наш ресторан в четверг 10.09.2020г. в первой половине дня! Наш персонал встретил вас как всегда с радушием и еще помогли вам с чемоданами! Никаких нареканий при расчете вы не говорили! Вам со счета убрали лимонад \"тархун\", так как вы подумали, что он собственного производства из натурального тархуна! Желание гостей для нас закон!\nШеф поваром тщательно проверены блюда, которые вы указали ! Никаких \"пересолов\" нет! Грузинская кухня имеет свои особенности-наличие специй, пряностей и острых ноток! Данные блюда целиком и полностью соответствуют рецептуре и стандартам вкуса! И если вам не понравилось, извините, но это ваше субъективное мнение и мы точно не заслуживаем такой оценки! Обычно гости обращаются к администрации, если что то не так! Вы этого не сделали! Тарелки были пустые)) Причем еду еще с собой забрали!\nМы уважаем позицию наших гостей - уважайте и нашу!\n\n(Translated by Google)\nGamarjoba! Thanks for your feedback! In everything, we strive to match the unique Georgian atmosphere, style, traditions and real Georgian cuisine!\n\nIn view of this review, we have sorted out the situation in detail! From our side, we can say the following, you visited our restaurant on Thursday 10.09.2020. in the first half of the day! Our staff welcomed you as always with cordiality and also helped you with your suitcases! You did not say any complaints about the calculation! Tarragon lemonade was removed from your account, because you thought it was of your own production from natural tarragon! The desire of our guests is our law!\nThe chef carefully checked the dishes that you indicated! There are no oversights! Georgian cuisine has its own characteristics - the presence of spices, spices and pungent notes! These dishes are fully consistent with the recipe and taste standards! And if you didn't like it, I'm sorry, but this is your subjective opinion and we definitely do not deserve such an assessment! Usually, guests contact the administration if something is wrong! You didn't! The plates were empty)) And they took the food with them!\nWe respect the position of our guests - respect ours too!",

Вас обслуживали две девушки официанта!!!\nВам в чек добавили что то лишнее, чего вы не заказывали???\nВам было включено в счет ОБСЛУЖИВАНИЕ!!! Вам предложили ознакомиться с прейскурантом цен, которые согласованы дирекцией!!!\nКакой закон мы нарушаем? Можно конкретней статью и номер пункта?\nЭто наша ценовая политика ресторана, многие рестораны Киева берут плату в чеке за обслуживание, тем самым оплачивают зарплату персонала в зале!!! При этом не поднимая цены на блюда!!! Думаю в лояльности наших цен вы убедились, как для центра города?\nИ не путайте обслуживание, с чаевыми, которые оставляют лично официанту в знак того, что гость остался довольным обслуживанием и кухней!\n\nКаждый ресторан имеет право на свою ценовую политику, а также стоимость услуг!!! Мы очень уважительно относимся к нашим гостям, и вы уважайте нашу работу!\nИ не пишите эту чушь про нарушение законов, если сами ничего в этом не понимаете!\nВыглядит это оскорбительно!\nА если вы это пишите в интересах конкурентов- вам удачи в этом нелегком деле!\n\nИ последнее - почему у вас столько негатива, если вам все понравилась? У вас был \"совсем не большой счет\", вы оплатили 50грн ОБСЛУЖИВАНИЯ двум официантам за более двух часовую работу!!! Нужно ценить не только себя, а и людей вокруг!!!\n\n(Translated by Google)\nGamarjoba! What were you DECEDED about? Judging by your feedback, you did not have any complaints either to the dishes or to the service! You were our guest for more than 2 hours, there were three of you! You were served by two girls of the waiter !!!\nSomething superfluous was added to your check, which you did not order ???\nYou have been included in the account SERVICE !!! You were offered to familiarize yourself with the price list of prices, which are agreed by the management !!!\nWhat law are we breaking? Can you be more specific about the article and paragraph number?\nThis is our pricing policy of the restaurant, many restaurants in Kiev take a payment on the check for service, thereby paying the salaries of the staff in the hall !!! At the same time, without raising the prices of dishes !!! I think you are convinced of the loyalty of our prices, as for the city center?\nAnd do not confuse the service with a tip, which is left personally to the waiter as a sign that the guest was satisfied with the service and cuisine!\n\nEach restaurant has the right to its own pricing policy, as well as the cost of services !!! We are very respectful of our guests and you respect our work!\nAnd do not write this nonsense about breaking laws if you yourself do not understand anything about it!\nIt looks insulting!\nAnd if you write this in the interests of your competitors, good luck in this difficult matter!\n\nAnd the last thing - why do you have so much negativity if you liked everything? You had a \"not a big bill\", you paid 50 UAH SERVICE to two waiters for more than two hours of work !!! You need to appreciate not only yourself, but also the people around !!!",
