Unfortunately, the waitress Oksana did not work on Monday, and we would be grateful for the name of the waiter who served you, so that such situations would not take place in the future. We would be particularly grateful to you if you could tell where exactly abroad in schools Ukrainian borscht, our Ukrainian national dish, is prepared. It is such a rarity to meet this dish abroad, especially since you rated it as \"2/5, something like a school cafeteria\".\nWe really hope that in the future we will be able to correct your impression of the Korchma Taras Bulba",

We would like to note that not a single restaurant service works by itself: it is a well-coordinated mechanism of the bar, the kitchen and only then the waiters. Unfortunately, neither the number of waiters, nor the speed of movement affects the cooking technology. Please note that the average cooking time for a dish on the Korchma menu is from 25 minutes, which we warn you about in advance. We hope that in general the time you spent in the Korchma did not disappoint you. Always yours, Tavern Taras Bulba",

We are glad that you pay attention to those details that are immutable rules for us: comfort, safety of our guests, quality of food and staff work. Unfortunately, the criterion \"they say that it was tastier before\" does not give us the opportunity to get your objective assessment of the dishes on our menu today. Thank you for evaluating the work of our musicians, but they work in Korchma only on weekends, the days of maximum seating of the halls.

It is even more unfortunate that you do not even pay attention to the name of the people who meet you in the institution (if you have good and readable badges with the name of employees) and find out from you about the availability of certain certificates. Communication is a two-way process.
